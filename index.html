                        released in 2011, being heavily inspired by a similar <br>
                        game by From Software known as Demon Souls. The game <br>
                        went on to create a new genre of action-role playing <br>
                        games known as the "Souls-like" genre. Dark Souls 2 <br>
                        would be released in 2014, being accompanied <br>
                        soon-after with the release of Dark Souls 3 in 2017. </font>

                        <font color="#80bf09";>Dark Souls II received critical acclaim, according to <br>
                        review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the game's <br>
                        atmosphere, and visuals in the game, seeing it as a large <br>
                        improvement over the first two installments in the series, <br>
                        but were polarized over the game's increased difficulty. <br>
                        Famitsu reviewed the game with four reviewers giving their <br>
                        opinions, who gave it 9/10/9/9, bringing the total score <br>
                        to 37/40. IGN's critic Marty Sliva gave the game a score <br>
                        of 9/10: "Dark Souls II is a smart, massive, and incredibly <br>
                        rewarding sequel. Itâ€™s crammed with deep systems, tense <br>
                        encounters, and enough clever multiplayer and New Game <br>
                        Plus elements to make me want to restart the second I saw <br>
                        the end credits. Not all of the tweaks and additions worked <br>
                        out for the best, the penalty for dying made the game almost <br>
                        unplayable but with such great enemies and levels to fight <br>
                        and explore, Dark Souls II made 60 hours of pain and agony <br>
                        so much fun they flew by in a heartbeat." Daniel Tack of <br>
                        Game Informer gave the game a 9.75 out of 10, stating: <br>
                        "Dark Souls II is an epic adventure from start to finish <br>
                        packed with wondrous environments, imaginative and terrifying <br>
                        foes, and the continual adrenaline-apprehension rush of passing <br>
                        through each fog gate makes this title a must-play." Polygon's <br>
                        Phil Kollar also gave it a 9/10, and similarly praised the <br>
                        ambition displayed by the team in creating such a vast RPG <br>
                        universe for the player to explore, the notorious difficulty, <br>
                        and the sense of triumph that comes with eventually defeating <br>
