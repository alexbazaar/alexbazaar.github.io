                Master Logan was a famous Sorcerer and a royal <br>
                member of the Vinheim Dragon School before he <br>
                turned Undead about one hundred years ago. His <br>
                nickname stems from the gigantic hat he wore <br>
                which completely hid his face; he used it to <br>
                block the noise and stares from those around <br>
                him in order to focus his thoughts. His weapon <br>
                was once an ordinary catalyst employed by the <br>
                Sorcerers of Vinheim, but it has since been <br>
                strengthened due to lengthy use over time. <br>
                Similarly, his robe is one typically worn by <br>
                apprentices at Dragon School. <br>

                Logan is credited with having developed the Soul <br>
                Spear Sorcery, among others, which is referenced <br>
                repeatedly in the legends and is said to be on<br>
                par with Lord Gwyn's lightning. In his attempt to <br>
                reach Anor Londo, presumably to gain access to The <br>
                Duke's Archives and its vast store of endless <br>
                knowledge, he became imprisoned in Sen's Fortress, <br>
                where he first encounters the Chosen Undead.<br>

                        Knight Artorias was one of the four Knights of <br>
                        Gwyn, the commanding knights of Lord Gwyn's army. <br>
                        Artorias had an unbendable will of steel, which <br>
                        both helped and fed his hatred for servants of <br>
                        the Dark, particularly the Darkwraiths of Kaathe.<br>

                        Lord Gwyn bequeathed him with a custom-made ring, <br>
                        the Wolf Ring, to assist in his already unmatched <br>
                        ability to wield a greatsword. When in New Londo <br>
                        Artorias discovered the ability of abysswalking; <br>
                        earning him his title: Artorias the Abysswalker. <br>
                        This allowed him to enter The Abyss, the home of <br>
                        the Darkwraiths and the Four Kings themselves. <br>
                        At some unspecified time in the past, when <br>
                        Oolacile was attacked by the Abyss, Artorias <br>
                        traveled to Oolacile to rescue Princess Dusk of <br>
                        Oolacile. <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Defeated by Manus and the Abyss, Artorias <br>
                        sacrificed his great shield to protect his loyal <br>
                        companion, a young Sif, from the myriad Humanity <br>
                        Sprites that littered the deepest reaches of <br>
                        Oolacile. With his left arm shattered following <br>
                        his confrontation with Manus, he had no use for <br>
                        the shield and chose to wield his greatsword in <br>
                        his one good hand. With time, Artorias became <br>
                        fully-corrupted by the Abyss (though, in hunting <br>
                        the corrupted denizens of Oolacile, it is clear <br>
                        he didn't wholly forget his mission). At some <br>
                        point after this, an unknown hero <br>
                        (The Chosen Undead) travelled back to the past <br>
                        and, in the process of relieving Oolacile of its <br>
                        corruption and rescuing Dusk, finally bested <br>
                        Artorias.<br>
                        <br>
                        
                        In doing so, The Chosen Undead preserved the lost <br>
                        knight's honour. Despite The Chosen Undead's feats, <br>
                        the saviour of Dusk and Oolacile would come to be <br>
                        attributed to Artorias. Rather than being corrupted <br>
                        by the Abyss like the rest of Oolacile, it was <br>
                        believed that he perished while facing the Abyss. <br>
                        Perhaps the only compatriot of Artorias that knew <br>
                        the truth was Sif, who in thanks for his rescue <br>
                        from the Abyss gifted The Chosen Undead Artorias' <br>
                        Cleansing Greatshield.
